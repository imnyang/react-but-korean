# React but Korean
React but it's Korean translated.
Forked [SaltyAom/react-but-thai](https://github.com/SaltyAom/react-but-thai)

## What
React but Korean is React but it's Korean translated with the same modern API.

## Intention
Because I can.

## Why
Don't ask why, ask Why not.

## When to use
When you want to.

## How
Install it
```bash
bun add react-but-korean react-dom-but-korean

// or with npm
npm install --save react-but-korean react-dom-but-korean

// or with yarn
yarn add react-but-korean react-dom-but-korean
```

Then use the same API but it's translated.

Use `반응형` instead of `react`
use `반응형문서객체형식` insteand of `react-dom`

### Example
```typescript
import 반응형 from 'react-but-korean'
import 반응형문서객체형식 from 'react-dom-but-korean'

import 응용프로그램 from './index.js'

반응형문서객체형식.표현하기(응용프로그램, document.body)
```
